# CogPred_HCP_EP
Analysis scripts for the manuscript O'Neill et al. 2024.
The scripts perform connectome-based predictive modeling on cortex-wide functional connectivity data to generate predictions of cognitive outcomes in the HCP-EP sample and on an external replication sample. The code also includes a virtual lesioning analysis to determine the impact of removing canonical networks from input features on prediction accuracy, as well as a misprediction analysis to identify clinical and demographic variables that are associated with misprediction.
